                development of a fintech app by designing and implementing the
                core payment feature. I utilized React Native, TamaGUI, and
                Supabase to create an efficient and scalable codebase. My
                hands-on experience with database design using Supabase enhanced

                complex applications."

                As part of a team, I successfully developed the MVP for a fintech mobile app within three months by 
                implementing 70% of core functionalities. Git was used to ensure efficient collaboration and version 
                control. Post-launch, I continued to provide support and enhancements to improve the app's performance 
                and user satisfaction. To reduce expenses, I selected a cost-effective KYC verification service that

                a responsive landing page using React and Next.js, and integrating Tally Form to effectively 
                collect leads. Collaboration with UI/UX designers was crucial to ensure consistency with 
                brand identity and pixel-perfect execution. To increase the maintainability and scalability 
                of the codebase, I created reusable components for the Sentinel dashboard. By working cross-functionally

                The website was deployed on Namecheap, including the purchase of a domain name and setting up a business email account for Kolat OAK
